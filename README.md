# Facial-Recognition-for-Missing-Person-Search-in-CCTV-Videos


This project leverages deep learning and facial recognition to assist in locating missing persons using CCTV footage. By analyzing real-time or recorded video frames, the system matches detected faces against a reference database of missing individuals.

## 🔍 Objective

To automate the search for missing individuals in public surveillance videos using facial recognition technology, thereby reducing manual effort and increasing the chances of timely identification.

## 📌 Features

- Face detection and recognition using OpenCV and deep learning models
- Comparison of CCTV video faces with a database of missing persons
- Real-time or recorded video support
- Image preprocessing and face embedding generation
- Alert generation when a potential match is found

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- face_recognition (based on dlib)
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras (if deep learning used)
- Streamlit (optional for UI)
- SQLite / CSV for storing known face encodings

##  How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sidra51/Facial-Recognition-for-Missing-Person-Search-in-CCTV-Videos.git

2. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Prepare your dataset
Place clear frontal face images of missing persons in the dataset/ folder. Filenames should be the person's name or ID.

3. Run the recognition script
python recognize.py
You can modify the video input in the script (recognize.py) to use live feed or a saved video file.
```
Output
> Names of matched persons displayed on-screen in real-time
> Optional: Save frames of matched detections in a separate folder
> Log file or terminal output showing match confidence

Limitations
> Accuracy depends on video quality, lighting, and angle of face
> Not effective with occluded or profile faces
> Requires clear reference images for reliable matches

Future Enhancements
> Integrate with public databases or police records
> Support for low-resolution face enhancement
> Add GUI using Streamlit or Flask
> Email/SMS alert system
